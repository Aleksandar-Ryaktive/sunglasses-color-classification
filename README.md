# sunglasses-color-classification
A model that would classify the color of a product


## Image Color Recognition

- The goal of this project was to build a model that would be able to detect one of the predefined 15 lens colors shown in images of sunglasses as product types.

- The predefined colors are:

    * black
    * blue
    * brown
    * burgundy
    * clear
    * gold

    * orange
    * pink
    * purple
    * rainbow
    * red
    * silver
    * yellow

## Description

**sunglasses-color-classification** is a Convolutional Neural Network model that recognizes one of the predefined 15 lens colors shown in sunglasses images.
